=> Locomotive Scroll - library used for applying various scrolling effects.
    it alters CSS transform property values on elements to create scrolling effects.
    they are used to create Parallax effects - some elements are made to look like they are deep in the background
    two key attributes to always call upon locomotive - 
    1. data-scroll - detects whether or not an element is in the viewport
    2. data-scroll-container - wraps all the HRTML content you want to watch for scrolling

=> effect 1 - paragraph darken word by word as the scroll is done further
we convert the paragraph inside the tag to span tag word by word, and to all span tag we apply
